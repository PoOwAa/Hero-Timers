# Hero's Timer Pack

These are timers by QuitarHero created for Charr's Timer Module.

These timers provide markers, trails, and timed warnings and alerts for Strikes, Raids and Dungeons. Some bosses have multiple timers for specific purposes, while others only have a single timer.

Timers are not dynamic, and can only be created and used for consistently timed, invariable events, such as Slothasor's Mushroom Spawns and Dhuum's Greens. They can not be reliably created for events such as Sabetha's Flamewall which can have its 45s interval interfered by one of the three minibosses.
